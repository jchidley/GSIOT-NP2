BUGS

QUESTIONS
 - HttpReader: provide more explicit configuration mechanism for symbolBufferCapacity?
 - HttpWriter: is maxWriteBufferSize == 1024 a good choice?
 - HttpServer.Run: implement exponential backoff upon DNS lookup failure?
 - SocketStream.Read: exception handling for timeouts, remote host connection closes?

TODO
 - update documentation
 - do more tests with multithreaded mode and connections that are kept open between requests
 - make HTTP processing more robust: http://programmingisterrible.com/post/50237666844/http-as-imagined-versus-http-as-found

 - plug-in mechanism for streams that are not socket-based
